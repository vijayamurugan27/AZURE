pip install azure-ai-vision-imageanalysis==1.0.0b1

Use the Azure AI Vision SDK to read text from an image


# import namespaces
from azure.ai.vision.imageanalysis import ImageAnalysisClient
from azure.ai.vision.imageanalysis.models import VisualFeatures
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential


# Authenticate Azure AI Vision client
cv_client = ImageAnalysisClient(
    endpoint=ai_endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(ai_key)
)



# Use Analyze image function to read text in image
result = cv_client.analyze(
    image_data=image_data,
    visual_features=[VisualFeatures.READ]

# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text
if result.read is not None:
    print("\nText:")

# Prepare image for drawing
image = Image.open(image_file)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(image.width/100, image.height/100))
plt.axis('off')

fig.savefig(outputfile)
print('\n  Results saved in', outputfile)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the code you just added in the GetTextRead function, and under the Return the text detected
 in the image comment, add the following code (this code prints the image text to the console 
 and generates the image text.jpg which highlights the image's text):

 # Return the text detected in the image
print(f"  {line.text}")    

drawLinePolygon = True

r = line.bounding_polygon
bounding_polygon = ((r[0].x, r[0].y),(r[1].x, r[1].y),(r[2].x, r[2].y),(r[3].x, r[3].y))

# Return the position bounding box around each line


# Return each word detected in the image and the position bounding box around each word with the confidence level of each word


# Draw line bounding polygon
if drawLinePolygon:
    draw.polygon(bounding_polygon, outline=color, width=3)



python read-text.py

# Return the position bounding box around each line
print("   Bounding Polygon: {}".format(bounding_polygon))

python read-text.py

Return to the code file in Visual Studio Code, and find the comment Return each word detected in the image and the position 
bounding box around each word with the confidence level of each word. Then, under this comment, add the following code:


# Return each word detected in the image and the position bounding box around each word with the confidence level of each word
for word in line.words:
    r = word.bounding_polygon
    bounding_polygon = ((r[0].x, r[0].y),(r[1].x, r[1].y),(r[2].x, r[2].y),(r[3].x, r[3].y))
    print(f"    Word: '{word.text}', Bounding Polygon: {bounding_polygon}, Confidence: {word.confidence:.4f}")

# Draw word bounding polygon
drawLinePolygon = False
draw.polygon(bounding_polygon, outline=color, width=3)
