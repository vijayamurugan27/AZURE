Add code to use the Azure OpenAI service

# Create a system message
system_message = """I am a hiking enthusiast named Forest who helps people discover hikes in their area. 
    If no area is specified, I will default to near Rainier National Park. 
    I will then provide three suggestions for nearby hikes that vary in length. 
    I will also share an interesting fact about the local nature on the hikes when making a recommendation.

Test your application

python test-openai-model.py

What hike should I do near Rainier?

Where should I hike near Boise? I'm looking for something of easy difficulty, between 2 to 3 miles, with moderate elevation gain.



Maintain conversation history

Where is a good hike near Boise?

How difficult is the second hike you suggested?


# Initialize messages array
messages_array = [{"role": "system", "content": system_message}]

Under the comment Add code to send requestâ€¦, replace all the code from the comment to the end of the while loop with the following code then save the file. The code is mostly the same, but now using the messages array to store the conversation history.

# Add code to send request...
# Send request to Azure OpenAI model
messages_array.append({"role": "user", "content": input_text})

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=azure_oai_deployment,
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1200,
    messages=messages_array
)
generated_text = response.choices[0].message.content
# Add generated text to messages array
messages_array.append({"role": "assistant", "content": generated_text})

# Print generated text
print("Summary: " + generated_text + "\n")
